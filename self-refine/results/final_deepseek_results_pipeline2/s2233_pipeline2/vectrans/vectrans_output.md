Unit Test analysis: 
Source code and optimized code semantics are inconsistent.

1. Check for Compilation Errors in Optimized Code:
- First, check if the Optimized Code compiles successfully.
- If there are compilation errors in the Optimized Code:

## **1. Check for Compilation Errors in Optimized Code**

The provided optimized code is just a function declaration:  

```c
void s2233_opt(int iterations, float aa[256][256], float bb[256][256], float cc[256][256]);
```

This is not a function definition — it’s a forward declaration.  
If this is the entire “optimized code” given, then it **will not compile** (no implementation).  

Thus, we **stop here** and output **FAIL**.  

---

**Reason for FAIL:**  
The “optimized code” is incomplete — it’s only a prototype, not a valid implementation, so compilation will fail.  

**Fix needed:**  
Provide a full function definition with the intended optimized logic.

**Final output:**  
FAIL

I want to vectorize the following loop,
could you reorganize the loop structure so that compiler can better vectorize it? 
don't vectorize it, just reorganize the loop. 
if there is loop-carried dependency , 
you can consider Loop splitting, Loop reordering, Instruction reordering, Loop distribution and other technicues to separate the dependency out.
Pay attention to the dependency between loops.
Choose a more simplified solution.

UnitTest Feedback:

Unit Test analysis: 
Source code and optimized code semantics are inconsistent.


**Objective**: Generate a semantically equivalent vectorize-friendly version of `*_opt` using:  
**Preservation Requirements**:  
1. Function signature

If the original value is used, e.g. a[i+1] is used for iteration i, a[i+1] should be stored in a temporary variable(use memcpy to store orign value) or used before updating a[i+1]
If the updated value is used, e.g. a[i-1] is used for iteration i, a[i-1] should update before using it.

**Possible Transformations**  
Loop Splitting:  
**Type 1 - Instruction Splitting**  
   *When to use*:  
   - Multiple independent statements exist within the loop body  
   - Example pattern:  
     ```c
     for(i) { 
       A[i] = ...;  // Independent group 1
       B[i] = ...;  // Independent group 2 
     }
     ```  
   *Implementation*:  
   ```c
   for(i) { A[i] = ...; }  // Split loop 1  
   for(i) { B[i] = ...; }  // Split loop 2  
   ```  
   *Validation*:  
   - Total iteration count remains identical  
   - Memory access order preserved across all arrays  

**Type 2 - Iteration Range Splitting**  
   *When to use*:  
   - Loop contains phase-dependent patterns (e.g., mid-point update)  
   - Vectorization blocked by conditional value changes  
   - Example pattern:  
     ```c
     for(i=0; i<LEN; i++) a[i] = a[mid] + b[i];  
     ```  
   *Implementation*:  
   ```c
   // Phase 1: i=0~mid (pre-update)  
   for(i=0; i<mid; i++) a[i] = a[mid] + b[i];  
   // Mid-point update  
   a[mid] = a[mid] + b[mid];  
   // Phase 2: i=mid+1~end (post-update)  
   for(i=mid+1; i<LEN; i++) a[i] = a[mid] + b[i];  
   ```  
   *Validation Checklist*:  
   - Split boundaries cover original iteration range  
   - No overlapping writes between split segments  

Loop Reordering and Instruction Reordering:
**Application Rules**:  
   *Priority Patterns*:  
   - Move loop-invariant computations upward  
     ```c
     // Before reorder:
     a[i] = x + y;  // y is invariant
     b[i] = y * z;
     
     // After reorder:
     b[i] = y * z;  // y used earlier
     a[i] = x + y;
     ```  
   - Solve loop dependency
    ```c
    // Before reorder:
     a[i] = b[i-1] + y;  // y is invariant
     b[i] = y * z;
     
     // After reorder:
     b[i] = y * z;  // y used earlier
     a[i] = b[i-1] + y;
     // Before reorder:
     a[i] = b[i-1] + y;  // y is invariant
     b[i] = a[i+1] * z;
     
     // After reorder:
     b[i] = a[i+1] * z;
     a[i] = b[i-1] + y;
     ```
   - Cluster memory operations with similar addresses 

Loop Distribution:
**When to Apply**:  
   - Multiple independent write targets in loop body  
   - Example:  
     ```c
     // Original
     for(i) {
       A[i] = ...;  // Writes to A
       B[i] = ...;  // Writes to B (independent)
     }
     
     // Distributed
     for(i) { A[i] = ...; }  
     for(i) { B[i] = ...; }  
     ```  
   *Validation*:  
   - Distributed loops must have identical iteration ranges  
   - No interleaved access between distributed loops  

Use temporary variable:
Use temp variable to store result to avoid complex memory access

Remove branching logic (if, else if, switch) from loops to enable automatic vectorization:
Replace multi-way conditionals with arithmetic masking, ensuring uniform execution paths across iterations.
**When to Apply**:  
    - Example:  
     ```c
    // Original
    if (cond1)  
        x = value_A;  
    else if (cond2)  
        x = value_B;  
    else  
        x = value_C;
    // Optimized  
    x = cond1 * value_A + (cond2 && !cond1) * value_B + (!cond1 && !cond2) * value_C;  
     ```

If the access pattern involves using a[i-1] and updating a[i] within the same iteration, a dependency exists. Attempt to reorder the instructions to resolve this dependency.

Improve the optimized code based on the preceding techniques and other optimization methods.

Okay, let's use this feedback to refactor the code and encapsulate the generated code with ``c ``. Do not change the function head tailed with _opt. Only generate one optimized code. Do not output other code.Do not output orign code.

## FEEDBACK OUTPUT
**Analysis**

**1. Compilation Errors in Optimized Code**  
The optimized code compiles successfully (no compilation errors).  

**2. Semantic Comparison**  
The original code processes both `aa` and `bb` updates **inside the same `i` loop** for each `i` from 1 to 255.  
The optimized code processes **all `aa` updates for all `i` first**, then **all `bb` updates for all `i`**.  

This changes the semantics because `bb` updates in the original code use `cc[i][j]` values **after** `aa` updates for the same `i` have been computed, but before `aa` updates for `i+1` begin. However, since `cc` is never modified, and `aa` and `bb` updates are independent of each other (no cross-dependency between `aa` and `bb`), the order of computing `aa` and `bb` across different `i` values does not affect final results.  

But there is a subtlety: In the original loop, for a given `i`, `aa` is updated for all `j`, then `bb` is updated for all `j` using `cc[i][j]`. Since `cc` is unchanged, and `aa` and `bb` do not depend on each other, the two loops can be safely separated. However, the original code’s structure means that for each `i`, both updates happen before moving to `i+1`. The optimized version processes all `i` for `aa` first, then all `i` for `bb`. This does **not** change the final values of `aa` and `bb` because:  
- `aa[j][i]` depends only on `aa[j-1][i]` and `cc[j][i]` (no dependence on `bb`).  
- `bb[i][j]` depends only on `bb[i-1][j]` and `cc[i][j]` (no dependence on `aa`).  

Thus, the optimized code is **semantically equivalent** to the original.  

**3. Vectorization Analysis**  
Compiler feedback shows:  
- The `bb` loop is vectorized (width 4, interleaved count 4).  
- The `aa` loop is **not vectorized** due to a backward loop-carried dependency:  
  `aa[j][i] = aa[j-1][i] + cc[j][i]` is a recurrence (each iteration depends on previous iteration’s result). This is a true dependency that prevents vectorization in its current form.  

Since the `aa` loop cannot be vectorized due to this recurrence, the optimized code is **not fully vectorized**.  

**4. Optimization Opportunities**  
The recurrence in the `aa` loop is inherent to the algorithm (prefix sum along columns). This cannot be vectorized in a straightforward way without changing the algorithm (e.g., using parallel prefix-sum techniques). However, the `bb` loop is vectorizable and has been vectorized.  

Given the constraints, the current optimized code is already doing as much as possible without algorithmic changes. The only way to make the `aa` loop vectorizable would be to change the computation pattern, which would alter semantics.  

Since the `aa` loop cannot be automatically vectorized due to a true dependency, and the `bb` loop is already vectorized, no further optimization is possible without changing the algorithm.  

**Conclusion**  
The optimized code is semantically correct and partially vectorized (`bb` loop vectorized, `aa` loop not vectorizable due to recurrence). No further modification is needed within the given algorithm constraints.  

**Output:** PASS
